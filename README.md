# Spotify Recommendation System

## 📌 Introduction
The **Spotify Recommendation System** leverages **collaborative filtering** and **content-based filtering** to analyze user preferences and suggest personalized song recommendations. This enhances the music discovery experience by providing users with relevant song suggestions based on their listening history and song characteristics.

## 🚀 Features
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Suggests songs based on user listening history and preferences.
- **Hybrid Filtering Approach**: Combines **collaborative filtering** and **content-based filtering** for better accuracy.
- **Real-time Analysis**: Continuously updates recommendations as users listen to more songs.
- **Scalable Model**: Efficiently handles a growing dataset of users and songs.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (Primary language)
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data processing)
- **Scikit-learn** (Machine learning models)
- **Spotify API** (Fetching user data and song features)
- **Flask / FastAPI** (Optional: Backend for API integration)




## 🎯 How It Works
1. **Collaborative Filtering**: Uses past user interactions to suggest songs based on similar user preferences.
2. **Content-Based Filtering**: Analyzes song features (tempo, genre, mood) to recommend similar songs.
3. **Hybrid Approach**: Combines both techniques for more precise recommendations.
